### Abstract
Software has become an integral part of our daily lives, impacting almost every aspect of modern society. However, with this increased reliance on software, a need to ensure its reliability, security, and ethical use also comes. In our work, we have highlighted the importance of writing clear and simple code to read, modify, and extend, and follows best practices and coding standards. Hence, we designed and developed a novel Recommendation System (RS) that integrates AI-based techniques to assess the overall quality of the code and recommend precise and comprehensible code for developers. The effectiveness of our proposed model is measured in terms of evaluation metrics like accuracy, recall, precision and F1-Score, along with other metrics such as Mean Average Precision for 100 samples (mAP@100), mAP@50, and Bilingual Evaluation Understudy 4 (BLEU-4) and compared with the existing systems like codeBERT, GraphCodeBERT, DeepCom etc. According to the experimental results, the proposed system performs better than the existing systems.
